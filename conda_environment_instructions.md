# Conda Environment Instructions

This project uses a Conda environment to manage dependencies for the AI Datasets project as a conda environment named `ai_datasets`. Follow these steps to set up the environment.

## Create environment

``` bash
conda env create -f conda_environment.yml
```

# Activate it

In Jupyter Notebook, you can activate the environment using:

``` bash
conda activate ai_datasets
```

Alternatively in VSCode, you can select the `ai_datasets` interpreter from the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) by searching for "Python: Select Interpreter".
